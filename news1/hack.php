                <p id="txt">NEW DELHI: Even as the government promotes more digital transactions, the country’s cyber security chief Gulshan Rai said on Thursday he rarely does any internet banking himself because he understands the “issues there”, hinting that people doing online transactions must be aware of the risks.
                    “There are issues like who is the regulator of digital marketplace? How do we handle the consumer grievances?... Frauds in ATMs and credit cards are very complex and solving them is a bit difficult,” Rai said at a conference chaired by consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan.
                    “I have a separate account that keeps small amount in the bank. If I have to do that in a debit card, I put 25,000 in that account and do transaction so that I don’t go to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,” he added.
